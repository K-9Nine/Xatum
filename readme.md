# Xatum Protocol

Xatum is a mining protocol which aims to be as simple and efficient as possible.
It is based on TCP and JSON.

While Xatum has been created for Xelis, it can be modified to work with other cryptocurrencies.

Read the specification [here](specification.md).

## Reference Xatum client
A reference Xatum client implementation for Xelis mining pools can be found in the
`xatum-reference-miner` folder.

## Important notice
The Xatum Protocol is still a draft.
Some features (such as encryption) are expected to be added before Xatum is considered stable.
